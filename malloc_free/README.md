- Learn how to use `malloc` to allocate memory dynamically
- Learn how to use `free` to deallocate memory
- Avoid common pitfalls such as memory leaks and double freeing

## Files

- `malloc_example.c`: Example code demonstrating the use of `malloc` and `free`
- `README.md`: This file

## Usage

To compile the example code, use:

```sh
gcc -o malloc_example malloc_example.c
```

To run the compiled program, use:
