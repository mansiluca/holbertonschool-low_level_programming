# C - Doubly Linked Lists

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists.

## Description

A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node contains data and two pointers - one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.

## Files

* `lists.h` - Header file containing all function prototypes and the structure definition
* Various C files with functions to manipulate doubly linked lists

## Requirements

* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`
* Code must follow the Betty style
* No global variables allowed
* Maximum of 5 functions per file
